The Game is corresponding to "TikTakToe" where we have to to join three crosses or noughts in intentation to win. 
Except using crosses and noughts, we used yello coins and red coins to make the game easy.
If someone who succesds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row will win the match.
